We can easily achieve this by listening to onItemClick event of multiselect.</p>\n<p>Demo: Two dropdowns one showing list of countries and on selecting the option from first dropdown the states are getting chnaged from second dropdown.</p>\n<p>In case of events changing the state of multiselect such as search changed, itemclicked etc multiselect also provieds extra parameter as the target of event.\nFor example, in case of itemSelect event, the selected item is provided by multiselect as its event target as shown below in example.\nDemo showing itemSelect event with $event</p>\n<p>Same is the case when rather than selecting item, if the whole group is selected by clicking on its category, multiselct gives us this event also with selected category as its category.\nDemo showing onGroupItemClick with $event.</p>\n<p>Multiselct in total has 9 events availbale with. Play with the following example to get overview of it.</p>\n<p>Demo: Example showing all events</p>\n<h2>Demo</h2>\n<p><ms-events></ms-events></p>\n<code-tabs>\n  <code-pane title=\"app/events.component.ts\" path=\"events/src/app/events.component.ts\">\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ms-events',\n  templateUrl: './events.component.html'\n})\nexport class EventsDemoComponent implements OnInit {\n  options;\n  message: string;\n\n  constructor() {}\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    // Retrieving data for dropdown\n    this.options = [{\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"name\": \"Manchester United\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"name\": \"Liverpool F.C.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 3,\n      \"name\": \"Chelsea F.C.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"name\": \"Arsenal F.C.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 5,\n      \"name\": \"FC Barcelona\"\n    }];\n  }\n\n  onOpenFired() {\n    this.message = 'I am open now, you can now click on any of my items ';\n  }\n\n  onCloseFired() {\n    this.message = 'Oops, I am closed';\n  }\n\n  onItemClickFired($event: any) {\n    this.message = `Yaay, u selected an item ${$event.name}`;\n  }\n\n  onGroupItemClickFired($event: any) {\n    this.message = `Ohh, you are a pro.
